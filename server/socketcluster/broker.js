     * A worker will not try to subscribe to the channel again if it is already subscribed to it.

     For the purpose of scaling SocketCluster across multiple machines, if you see this event triggered for a particular channel,
     then you know that the current broker is interested in that channel,
     so you can use an MQTT, AMQP, or Redis client of your choice to create a matching channel subscription on a remote Pub/Sub cluster -
     This allows you to extend the subscription to an external pub/sub service.
