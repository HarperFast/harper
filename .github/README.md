## build.yaml
### Description
This workflow is for building the harperdb tar for all "Build Package" tests. 

This workflow uses the "version" in package.json to create the tar name and the "engines.node" value to build the tar in an appropriate `node:*-bullseye` container.

### Trigger
This workflow is triggered by other workflows that use it

### Inputs
N/A

### Outputs
1. nodeVersion
2. harperdbVersion

### Artifacts
1. harperdb-\<version\>.tar

## create-instances.yaml
### Description
This workflow is for running the terraform required to create all necessary instances for the tests to run.

### Trigger
This workflow is triggered by other workflows that use it

### Inputs
1. instanceCount - How many instances to create
    * Required
2. instanceType - AWS instance type for all instances
    * Default: "c5.2xlarge"
3. volumeSize - Volume size to attach to all instances
    * Default: "32"
4. harperdbVersion
    * Required
5. installType - Used to determine if tar should be uploaded to instances
    * Default: "buildPackage"
6. harperdb-\<version\>.tgz
    * If using a "buildPackage" install type there must be an artifact as a part of a previous job containing the harperdb tar

### Outputs
