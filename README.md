## HarperDB Overview
HarperDB is a turn-key solution for the collection, distribution, and analysis of data throughout your organization. Projects that have historically taken months (or even years) of consulting, configuration, and custom development can be completed in days or weeks with HarperDB.

HarperDB provides unmatched flexibility, security, and value for just about every use case, and we do it all with a single installation that can run in the cloud, on-premise, and at the edge.
