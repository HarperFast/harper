Check out our [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.harperdb.io/docs/getting-started) to learn how to install and use Harper.

## What is HarperDB?

HarperDB is our previous name. Earlier in 2025, [we rebranded](https://www.harper.fast/announcements/harperdb-proclaims-new-era-for-web-performance-with-corporate-rebrand) to just "Harper" to reflect our evolution from a database to a full performance platform. The core technology remains the same, but we've expanded our vision to encompass more than just database functionality. Since this repo was created from the existing Harper codebase, you may still see references to the old name "HarperDB" in certain places.
