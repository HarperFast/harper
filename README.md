## HarperDB Overview
HarperDB is a turn-key solution for the collection, distribution, and analysis of data throughout your organization. Projects that have historically taken months (or even years) of consulting, configuration, and custom development can be completed in days or weeks with HarperDB.

HarperDB provides unmatched flexibility, security, and value for just about every use case, and we do it all with a single installation that can run in the cloud, on-premises, and at the edge.

## HarperDB APIs

The preferred way to interact with HarperDB for typical querying, accessing, and updating data (CRUD) operations is through the REST interface, described in the REST documentation.

The complete [HarperDB Operations API documentation](https://docs.harperdb.io/docs/operations-api/README.md) provides important administrative functions. Generally it is recommended that use the [RESTful interface](https://docs.harperdb.io/docs/rest/README.md) as your primary interface for scalable and performant data interaction for building production applications, and the operations API for administrative purposes.
